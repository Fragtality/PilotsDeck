# Pilot's Deck
Directly control Prepar3D&#x00AE; from your StreamDeck&#x00AE; via FSUIPC!

## Introduction
As the Title suggests, this is a Plugin for Elegato's StreamDeck for the FlightSimmers out there in need of just more Buttons! :wink:<br/>
It is build arround FSUIPC - so nearly everything which can be done with FSUIPC, can also be done via this Plugin. It is for the FlightSimmer already familiar with FSUIPC looking for an interesting Device to bind their Commands.<br/>
The Plugin is designed to be highly flexible and customizable, so it won't give any nice Guidance on what Offsets, Controls, Macros, ... are and it won't give you a nice List of Controls to select from. It even does not have anything pre-configured on the "COM Radio" Action - so you can make it work which fits best four your Aircraft(s).<br/><br/>
The Communication is Bi-Directional - it does not only send Commands into the Sim, it can also read & display a Controls State and can basically display any Value you want.<br/>
Another "Highlight" would be that you can "read" (generate) Values via Lua-Scripts.

## Plugin Requirements
Uhm ... I'd say Prepar3D, FSUIPC and StreamDeck (Software) installed would be a bloody good Start :laughing:<br/>
It is compiled for .NET Framework 4.8, so if you have a more or less regulary patched Windows&#x00AE; 10 (>= 1809) and have all of the above running you're probably ready for Takeoff!<br/>
It may work with FSX and older Versions of P3D/FSUIPC. It just works on Windows.<br/>

## Plugin Installation
It is not (yet) distributed in the StreamDeck Store, so it is a manual Installation for now.<br/>
Just put the Contents of the Zip in your Plugin-Folder under<br/>
> **%appdata%\Elgato\StreamDeck\Plugins**<br/><br/>
Optional: If you need/want to read Values generated by Lua-Scripts, you have to add the [PilotsDeck.lua](https://github.com/Fragtality/PilotsDeck/blob/master/PilotsDeck/lua/PilotsDeck.lua) Script in the \lua Subfolder to your FSUIPC Installation as an Autostart Script. More Instructions can be found in that File.

## Overview of included Actions
As of now, there are 7 Actions:<br/>
* **Display Value** - Read any Offset, Lvar (and Lua - more on that later) Value and display it as Text. You can Scale, Round, Format and/or BCD-Decode the Value and you can customize the resulting Text to your liking.
* **Display Value (with) Switch** - Same as before, but you can bind Macro(s), Control(s), Lvar(s) an Offset or a Lua-Script to it so that the Button does actually do something.
* **Simple Button** - As simple as it gets - a straight-forward Button like any of your Joystick-Buttons. BUT: it can be added to Multi-Actions in StreamDeck, so you can build Action-Sequences!
* **Dynamic Button** - My Reason to start this Journey - a Button which reflects the actual State of a Control in the Sim! It does not matter from which Input Device you alter a Control: this Button will show the correct State. (As long as this State can be correctly read from the Sim / Aircraft)
* **COM Radio** - It is more or less a "Display Value Switch" with two Values instead of one. Read the Radios from anywhere you want (BCD encoded or Integer) and swap the Frequencies by any Way you want.
* **Display Gauge** - If you want a graphical Representation of a Value, let's say for your Engines N1 Value, Trim, Control Surface Deflection, Fuel Level ... this Action is for you! It can either be a Bar or an Arc. With Text or without.
* **Display Gauge Dual** - New! Now with two Indicators instead of one! So you can have your Left/Right, Engine 1/Engine 2 or whatever on one Button.

## Action Configuration
Now we're getting to the "Fun" part! :flushed:<br/>
The Actions behave like any other Actions on the StreamDeck. They can be moved arround, swapped, copy-pasted and put in Folders. In case of the "Simple Button" it can be put in Multi-Actions like normal. Only replacing one Type with another could lead to unexpected Results and is "not recommended".<br/>
All Configuration is done via the Property Inspector. Some Input-Fields combine multiple Fiels/Inputs in one string, so let's start with the common Syntax:
### Common Syntax
Plain Numeric Values are separated by ";". E.g. an Size or Range Definition like "0; 10"<br/>
Addresses and Format are separated by ":".
#### Addresses
* **Offset**
  \[ Hex-Address*:*Size(*:*Type*:*Signedness) ]
  - _Hex-Address_: As seen in FSUIPC's Offsets Status Document (first column). A 4-digit Hex-Number. It can be prefixed with 0x and can be written in upper- or lower-case (the PI will only check mark upper-case, but lower-case does work).
  - Size: The Size of this Offset in Bytes (same Document, second column). A 1-digit Number.
  - Type: Specify if the Offset is Integer \[i], Float/Double \[f] or String \[s]. Defaults to ":i" for Integers if not specified.
  - Signedness: Specify if the Offset is Signed \[s] or Unsigned \[u]. Defaults to ":u" for Unsigned if not specified.
  Examples:
    - 2118:8:f for "Turbine Engine 2 corrected N1" (8 byte double/float64)
    - 034E:2 for "COM1 frequency in BCD" (2 byte integer)
    - 3544:4:i:s for "standby alitmeter in feet" (4 byte signed integer)
* **Lvar**
  \[ (L:)Name | (L:)Name((:L):Name)* ]
  - The Lvar's Name with or without the preceding "L:". For Switches you can bind multiple Lvars to it, every Lvar is separated by ":". Multiple Lvars only make sense if they react same for a same value (e.g. Landing Light Switches, all reacting as "on" for "1")
* **Control**
  \[ Control(:Parameter)* ]
  - The known "FS Controls". First the Control-Number and then 0 or more Parameter for that Control. (e.g. Landing Light Switches, move them up two times and/or move multiple at one)
* **Macro**
  \[ File\:Macro(:Macro) ]
  - File: The FSUIPC Macro File Name without Extension
  - Macro: The Macro's Name within that File. You can specify multiple Macros within one File (e.g. both Packs-Controls on one Button)
* **Script**
  \[ Lua:File ]
  - The Filename of a Lua-Script (known to FSUIPC). Without Extension and it has to be preceded with "Lua:".
